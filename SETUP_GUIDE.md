# Setup & Submission Guide - Web3Bridge Assessment

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Done

All features have been implemented and pushed to separate branches on your repository:

### Branches Created:

1. **`main`** - Initial codebase with existing quiz game
2. **`feat/questions-json`** - JSON question bank and API endpoint (DELETED - per your request)
3. **`feat/realtime-leaderboard`** - Firebase Realtime Database integration
4. **`feat/timer-and-enhancements`** - Per-question timer and error handling
5. **`feat/tests-and-documentation`** - Tests and comprehensive documentation

### Repository: 
`https://github.com/Timeless-Dave/web3bridge-assessment-filla-.git`

## üöÄ What You Need to Do

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, make sure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
cd C:\Users\USER\Filla
npm install
```

If you want to run tests, also install test dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @vitest/ui @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
```

### 2. Merge Feature Branches (Optional)

You can merge the feature branches into main if you want all features in one branch:

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge realtime leaderboard
git merge feat/realtime-leaderboard --no-ff -m "Merge: realtime leaderboard feature"

# Merge timer and enhancements
git merge feat/timer-and-enhancements --no-ff -m "Merge: timer and error handling"

# Merge tests and documentation
git merge feat/tests-and-documentation --no-ff -m "Merge: tests and documentation"

# Push merged main
git push origin main
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase (Optional - for Realtime Leaderboard)

The leaderboard works with localStorage by default, but for realtime functionality:

#### Step 1: Create Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project"
3. Name it (e.g., "filla-web3bridge")
4. Follow the wizard (disable Google Analytics if you want)

#### Step 2: Enable Realtime Database
1. In your Firebase project, click "Realtime Database"
2. Click "Create Database"
3. Choose a location (e.g., us-central1)
4. Start in **test mode** (for development)

#### Step 3: Get Configuration
1. Go to Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon)
2. Scroll to "Your apps"
3. Click the web icon (`</>`) to add a web app
4. Copy the configuration values

#### Step 4: Create `.env.local`
Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_project_id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
```

**Note**: If you skip this step, the app will work fine with localStorage!

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
# Run development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and test:
- ‚úÖ Sign in flow
- ‚úÖ Category selection
- ‚úÖ Question answering
- ‚úÖ Timer (30 seconds per question)
- ‚úÖ Score calculation
- ‚úÖ Leaderboard display

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### 6. Deploy to Vercel

#### Method 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
2. Click "Add New" ‚Üí "Project"
3. Import your repository: `Timeless-Dave/web3bridge-assessment-filla-`
4. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: **Next.js**
   - Root Directory: `./` (default)
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
5. Add Environment Variables (if using Firebase):
   - Click "Environment Variables"
   - Add each `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` variable
6. Click "Deploy"

#### Method 2: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel
```

### 7. Get Your Deployment URL

After deployment, Vercel will provide a URL like:
```
https://web3bridge-assessment-filla-<random>.vercel.app
```

Share this URL in your submission!

## üéØ Submission Steps

1. **Verify Repository**: Make sure all branches are on GitHub
   - `main`
   - `feat/realtime-leaderboard`
   - `feat/timer-and-enhancements`
   - `feat/tests-and-documentation`

2. **Deploy to Vercel**: Follow step 6 above

3. **Create Pull Requests** (Optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Create PRs on GitHub for each feature branch ‚Üí main
   ```
   This shows your git workflow skills!

4. **Fill Submission Form** with:
   - GitHub Repository URL: `https://github.com/Timeless-Dave/web3bridge-assessment-filla-.git`
   - Deployed URL: Your Vercel URL
   - Any additional notes

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel
- Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check that `next.config.js` is correct
- Verify TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`

### Tests Fail
- Install test dependencies: see step 1
- Run `npm test` locally first
- Check `vitest.config.ts` configuration

### Firebase Not Working
- Verify `.env.local` has correct values
- Check Firebase Realtime Database rules (should allow read/write)
- **Don't worry**: App works fine without Firebase (uses localStorage)

### Timer Not Showing
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure you're on a branch that includes timer (merged main or `feat/timer-and-enhancements`)

---
